## 💻 **my approach !**

for each problem, i aim to:
1. solve it with an initial approach (often brute force)
2. find a more efficient solution (mathematical insight)
3. compare performance and explain the trade-offs

**focus:** clean code, clear explanations, understanding the underlying mathematics
